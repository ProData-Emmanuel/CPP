THE RGB Color Scheme;
The colors of an image are determined by its pixel values. An RGB image has 3 color channels - Red, Green and Blue. Here, each color Channel has a pixel value ranging from 0 to 255. For example, the number 0 in a channel means there's no color, and 255 means there's 100% color. If a pixel value is represented by [255,255,0], it means that we have 100% Red and Green colors, and there is no Blue color.

Grayscale colors are special in the RGB color scheme because every grayscale color (from white to black to all shades of gray always has equal values for R, G and B.

Due to this, grayscale colors can be represented by a single number as opposed to the three numbers that three color channels require in RGB. A grayscale image hence has only one channel, where the pixel values range from 0 to 255. The pixel value 0 represents black and the value 255 represents white. The method of conversion of images from RGB, HSV, etc to a grey shaded image is called Grayscaling.
